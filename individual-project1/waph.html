            <h2>Course Description</h2>
            <p>In this course, students will study basic web application development with front-end (HTML5, JavaScript, CSS) and back-end (PHP/MySQL). Web application vulnerabilities and attacks will be introduced and explored with hands-on exercises on the range. Secure programming principles and practices will be introduced to avoid potential web application vulnerabilities and attacks.</p>

            <h2>Course Goals and Objectives</h2>
            <p>Students will have the ability to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Obtain the ability and skills to effectively use state-of-the-art techniques in web application development and security tools for the analysis, design, and implementation of secure web systems.</li>
                <li>Enhance students’ programming skills to develop secure, robust, sustainable software products.</li>
                <li>Establish security analysis skills to identify and avoid potential web vulnerabilities.</li>
                <li>Identify the types of security threats and perform attacks in web applications and adopt corresponding countermeasures to prevent such attacks.</li>
                <li>Obtain the ability and skills to apply practical knowledge of security in designing and implementing web applications with contemporary programming technologies.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Course Outcomes</h2>
            <p>Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Design, implement, and evaluate a web-based solution to meet a given set of computing requirements in the context of the program’s discipline.</li>
                <li>Understand the principle aspects of concepts of web application security.</li>
                <li>Identify and discuss the types of security threats and attacks in web applications and practical experience with hands-on exercises.</li>
                <li>Adopt corresponding countermeasures to identified threats in web applications and argue their effectiveness.</li>
                <li>Apply practical knowledge of security in designing and implementing web applications with contemporary technologies.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Textbook</h2>
            <p>There is no required textbook for this course. Lecture handouts are provided for every class. A good reference book (Free PDF online): “Learning PHP, MySQL & JavaScript: A Step-by-Step Guide to Creating Dynamic Websites,” Robin Nixon, O'Reilly Media, 6th Edition (2021). Additional readings will be posted correspondingly before lectures.</p>
