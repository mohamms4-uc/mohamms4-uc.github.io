This is a public repository hosted on github.io for Project 1. The organization of this repository is as follows.


## Overview

In this project, I developed a professional profile website using front-end web development skills and deployed it on GitHub Pages. The project involved creating a personal website with my resume, contact information, and educational background. Additionally, I integrated JavaScript functionalities, public APIs, and a page tracker. The project is designed to target potential employers and showcases my web development abilities.

## General Requirements

I met the general requirements of uploading a headshot, contact info, and my name by using the basic HTML template we used in Lab0. This is very easy as you're just using basic HTML tags. I used the **href** tag to link the page to my **waph.html** file which takes you to another webpage. 

## Non-technical Requirements

I used an external sheet from https://www.w3schools.com/css/demo_default.css to give the overall template of my website. In the beginning og my file, you can see all of my internal CSS that I used to style the different aspects of my template. I also used in-line CSS when styling different words or phrases.

## Technical Requirements

### Functionalities
The digital and analog clocks are included in the sidebar. In the 'About Me' section, you can click 'here!' to show/hide my email. Another functionality I implemented was page navigation. When you click the tabs, it navigates you to another page.

### jQuery & other Frameworks
The fetchJoke function uses jQuery's $.get method to fetch a joke from the API and display it in the sidebar. The other open-source library I am using is for the analog-clock (https://waph-uc.github.io/clock.js) provided for us from Lab 2 and also I used the w3schools library template for my external CSS reference. 

### Two Public APIs
In the sidebar to the righthand side, I implement the weather API and the joke API. Each API has a clickable link cited underneath to show it is not my work. 

### JavaScript Cookies
The website can track if you're a returning visitor and also documents the last time in which you joined the page. This can be found under the main header of the page.
